Hi, I'm Adrian, and I make toys.

That often involves writing code, either to make toymaking tools or to create parametric designs. 

I've set up this account to share code and other text-based resources related to indie toy design and toy making.

If you'd like to learn more about what I do, have a look at ![my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@zanzastoys)
